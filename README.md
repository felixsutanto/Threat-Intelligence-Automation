# Threat Intelligence Automation

A professional-grade Python script that automatically aggregates, parses, and reports on Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from multiple public threat intelligence feeds. This tool demonstrates practical DevSecOps automation capabilities for cybersecurity professionals.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project showcases the automation of threat intelligence collection and reporting, a critical capability in modern Security Operations Centers (SOCs). The script fetches real-time threat data from multiple sources, processes it for actionable intelligence, and generates professional reports for security analysts.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Feed Aggregation**: Automatically fetches data from multiple threat intelligence sources
- **IOC Parsing & Validation**: Extracts and validates malicious IPs and URLs with robust error handling
- **Data Deduplication**: Eliminates duplicate indicators while preserving threat classification
- **Professional Reporting**: Generates detailed Markdown reports with executive summaries
- **Production-Ready Code**: Implements retry logic, comprehensive logging, and error recovery
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean, maintainable code structure suitable for enterprise environments

## üîç Threat Intelligence Sources

The script currently integrates with these public threat feeds:

1. **Feodo Tracker (Abuse.ch)**
   - **Data**: C2 Botnet IP Addresses
   - **Format**: CSV
   - **Update Frequency**: Real-time
   - **Use Case**: Network monitoring and blocking

2. **URLhaus (Abuse.ch)**
   - **Data**: Recent Malware-Associated URLs
   - **Format**: CSV with threat classification
   - **Update Frequency**: Continuous
   - **Use Case**: Web filtering and threat hunting

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Internet connection for accessing threat feeds
- Write permissions in the current directory (for report generation)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files:**
   ```bash
   # Download the three main files:
   # - threat_aggregator.py
   # - requirements.txt
   # - README.md
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python threat_aggregator.py
   ```

### Expected Output

The script will:
1. Display real-time progress as it fetches and processes each feed
2. Show summary statistics of IOCs discovered
3. Generate a timestamped Markdown report (e.g., `threat_report_2024-01-15_143022.md`)

## üìä Sample Report Structure

The generated reports include:

```markdown
# Threat Intelligence Report

**Generated:** 2024-01-15 14:30:22 UTC
**Feeds Processed:** 2
**Total IOCs Found:** 1,247

## Executive Summary
- 892 malicious IP addresses
- 355 malware-associated URLs

## Malicious C2 IP Addresses
| IP Address | Status |
|------------|--------|
| 192.0.2.1  | Active C2 |

## Malware-Associated URLs
| URL | Threat Type |
|-----|-------------|
| hxxp://malware.example[.]com | malware_download |
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design

### Code Structure

```
threat_aggregator.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Configuration Section      # Feed URLs and settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Utility Functions         # IP/URL validation helpers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Data Fetching Functions   # HTTP requests with retry logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Data Parsing Functions    # Feed-specific parsers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Data Consolidation       # Deduplication and merging
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Report Generation        # Markdown report creation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Main Execution          # Orchestration logic
```

### Key Design Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each function has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Configurability**: Easy to modify feed sources without changing core logic
- **Extensibility**: Simple to add new threat intelligence feeds
- **Maintainability**: Heavily commented code with clear documentation

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Threat Feeds

To add a new threat intelligence source, modify the `THREAT_FEEDS` configuration:

```python
THREAT_FEEDS = {
    'your_new_feed': {
        'name': 'Your Threat Feed Name',
        'url': 'https://example.com/threat-feed.csv',
        'type': 'ip_addresses',  # or 'malware_urls'
        'description': 'Description of the feed'
    }
}
```

Then implement a corresponding parser function following the existing patterns.

### Configuration Options

Key settings can be modified at the top of the script:

- `HTTP_TIMEOUT`: Request timeout in seconds (default: 30)
- `MAX_RETRIES`: Number of retry attempts for failed requests (default: 3)
- `RETRY_DELAY`: Delay between retry attempts (default: 2 seconds)

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Manual Testing

1. **Network Connectivity Test**:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/downloads/ipblocklist.csv
   ```

2. **Python Environment Test**:
   ```bash
   python -c "import requests, csv, datetime; print('Dependencies OK')"
   ```

3. **Script Execution Test**:
   ```bash
   python threat_aggregator.py
   ```

### Expected Behavior

- **Success Case**: Script completes with generated report file
- **Network Issues**: Script retries failed requests and continues with available data
- **Partial Failures**: Script processes successful feeds and notes failures in output
- **Complete Failure**: Script exits gracefully with error message

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- **No Credential Storage**: Script uses only public, unauthenticated feeds
- **Safe URL Handling**: URLs are validated and sanitized before processing
- **Timeout Protection**: HTTP requests include timeouts to prevent hanging
- **Error Isolation**: Feed failures don't crash the entire script

## üìà Professional Use Cases

This script demonstrates several key DevSecOps capabilities:

1. **Automation**: Eliminates manual threat intelligence collection
2. **Integration**: Can be integrated into SIEM/SOAR platforms
3. **Monitoring**: Suitable for scheduled execution (cron jobs)
4. **Reporting**: Generates analyst-ready documentation
5. **Scalability**: Architecture supports adding multiple feeds

## üö¶ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Connection timeout" errors:**
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify threat feed URLs are accessible
- Increase `HTTP_TIMEOUT` if needed

**"No IOCs found" in report:**
- Verify threat feeds are returning data
- Check if feed formats have changed
- Review parser functions for the specific feeds

**Permission errors:**
- Ensure write permissions in current directory
- Check if antivirus is blocking script execution
